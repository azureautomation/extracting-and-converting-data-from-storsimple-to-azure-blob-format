Extracting and converting data from StorSimple to Azure blob format
===================================================================

            

This script converts data from StorSimple to Azure blob format. You can specify which volume containers contain the data of interest, which file extension types you want to convert, and what your destination storage account is. After conversion, you can
 use the blob data with Azure Media Services, HDInsight, AzureML, Azure Data Lake analytics etc.


 

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
